#Treehouse HDify
Treehouse HDify is a simple chrome extension that upgrades the "iTunes Feed" subscription link on teamtreehouse.com courses to subscribe to an HD feed. I've used teamtreehouse.com in the past to pick up some new knowledge and I wished there was a way to download/subscribe to the HD versions for offline viewing as the low resolution videos were difficult reading the code. Although this is just simple javascript, please run this at your own risk and follow safe security practices when it comes to side loaded software.

###Installation & Use:

- Side loading of packaged chrome extensions is no longer allowed by Chrome except in Developer mode. [Google Announcement](http://chrome.blogspot.ca/2014/05/protecting-chrome-users-from-malicious.html)
- To install the extension, download the source code and move it to a directory you with to run it from.
- Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions to open the extensions settings page.
- Check "Developer mode" in the upper right corner.
- To load the extension, select "Load unpacked extension" and navigate to the code directory.
- "iTunes Feed" will now say "iTunes HD Feed" on teamtreehouse.com course pages and will launch iTunes and subscribe to the HD content feed.
